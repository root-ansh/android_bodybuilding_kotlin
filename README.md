# BodyBuilding App Kotlin


This is the kotlin version of the app that i made [last weekend](https://github.com/root-ansh/lco).  This weekend I thought of trying kotlin, 
so made this app.It was a fun experience .Kotlin almost reduced my code by 50%.  

What's more , I tried view binding  library from google in this mini app. viewbinding is the
ultimate tool that i just loved :D
